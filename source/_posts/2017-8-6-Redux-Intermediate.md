title: Redux Selectors, Sagas, Middlewares and more...
author: Ale Arce
summary: >
          This article is aimed to show some middle level angles when using
          Redux in the front end. Here we will cover some <b><i>non-typical</i></b>
          actors / tools, identifying their roles and limitations. By doing
          this, I intend to explain how important is to decouple responsibilities.

I will try to explain how you can<b> shape your assets in the frontend</b> so you can keep an organized structure... If I am lucky, I will receive some feedback on this and then I can perform updates on this post.
